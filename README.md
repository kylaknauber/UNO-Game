# UNO
This is a React application which recreates an UNO game played between the user and the computer. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a shuffled deck containing all the UNO cards. The application then randomly decides which player will begin the game, to which they can place any card of their choosing from their current hand. The game continues until one player has no cards left, who will then be announced as the winner. The application keeps track of the number of wins the user accumulates until they decide to quit the game. Upon quitting, the user will have the option to save their name, score, and date played to a Firestore database. This application also includes the special cards from the original UNO game including skip, reverse, draw 2, and wild.
